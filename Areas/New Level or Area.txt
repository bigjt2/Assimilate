Steps to Add a New Level:

>>Background:
x1.  Code metatiles and attributes into appropriate background.i file.
x2.  Add the init_pb_attrXX table at bottom of appropriate background.i file.
x3.  Add the bg pallette for the level in background1.i file.  Remember, ALL are in bg1.i.
x4.  Add the new background, attribute, init_pb_attrib, bg & sp palette indexes in numbers.i.

>>Collision/Arrows:
x5.  Code collision objects and arrow positions into appropriate collision_objects.i file.
x6.  Add the new collision_object and arrow_location indexes in numbers.i.

>>Enemy & Item Data:
- Add a label under level_object_index in object_tables.i.  Also, be sure to
    add the new .dw label in the binary data under level_object_index at the
    top of the file.

>>Bank Mapping:
x13. Add correct starting PRG and CHR banks in bank_map table within numbers.i.
     MAKE SURE you add the word pointer indexes under the bank_map label.

>>Level Variables Init:
x14. In appropriate level_startsX.asm file, add the new start data.
    The following variables will most likely need adjusted: level, metatile_indx,
    frst_Background, finl_Background.
    Adjust others later for desired difficulty level and aesthetics.

>>Cutscenes:
15. In cs_starts.asm, add the lead-in for new level's cutscene.
16. In cut_scene.asm, add the new CS_InitX and change the text in the text
    tables at the bottom as needed.
17. Also add the new init label in CutScene_Init_JumpTable near bottom.
18. Add new data in the tables CutSceneTimes and CutSceneEvents.

>>Final:
19. Add lables for Cutscene Start and Level Start lables in level_startups table
    near the bottom of assimilate.asm file.
20. Adjust the CURRENT MAX hardcodes in Title_Screen sub within title_screen.asm file.
    Also, near the bottom add the appropriate number in Title_level_index table so
    the title screen jumps to correct starting position.

21. Save everything and prepare to have all kinds of fun debugging!
